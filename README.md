# Bike Sharing Project
## Overview of Project
Based on a recent trip to New York City where we used the Citi Bikes to easily travel from one place to the other we had the idea to develop a proposal for a bike sharing service in De Moines, Iowa.  By preforming an analysis on the publicly available data from Citi Bike we will be able to identify the areas of opportunity and where to begin with this project in De Moines, Iowa by comparing placement of biking docks, planning for maintenance and the peak times of day that the bikes may be in use.  Potential Investors have requested an analysis and we hope to be able to get buy in from them on our proposal with our findings.

This visualization shows that a large majority of rides last approximately 5 minutes, after that the number of rides steadily decreases.

This visualization depicts that there is not necessarily a difference in the duration of the trip based on gender.  The trend for Males and Females is similar (Males peak trip duration is 5 minutes while Females peak at 6 minutes).

Similar to rush hour times during the work week the number of rides appears to clustered around the morning, 7AM-9AM and evening, 5PM to 7PM commuting times.

While this visualization allows to filter by gender there does not appear to be a significant difference between the times of day or day of the week that either males or females were utilizing the bikes.

This highlights that Males have a higher utilization of bike sharing and are subscribers to the service in particular.  Additionally, the highest use appears to be on Thursday and the lowest utilization for this group on Sundays.  Female subscribers also have the highest utilization on Thursdays but the change among days of the week appears to be less drastic.


## Summary

Overall the analysis results reveal several important key items about the demographic and times of day and week that the bike sharing service would most be utilized.  Regarding demographics bike sharing appears to be most popular among Males, subscribers in particular are more likely to have a higher utilization.  We also show that the typical trip duration is at or under 5-6 minutes, this can help inform placement of the bike sharing docks to ensure they are easy to get to in that amount of time.

Additional visualizations that I would create with this data set include making a comparison of the time of day and duration of the rides to see if there is an impact on the average we are seeing.  Also, I would want to know if there is an impact on utilization from Customers and Subscribers based on starting and ending locations.  These will give an additional view into how we may want to structure our network.
